        "transcript": "Dear Kowolik,\n\nHello! It's me, Glenn Seavey, your Hawaiian Sales Consultant at Larry Genere Ford. As you probably know, I am originally from Hawaii. I love the food and the culture and would like to share this love with you. The recipe below for Basic Adobo is one of my favorites. It is a Phillipino dish that is very easy to make and \"ono\" good.\n\nBasic Adobo Ingredients: 3 1b. chicken thighs or 3 1b. pork butt 1/2 cup vinegar 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 cloves of garlic 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns, crushed 1 bay leaf, crushed Cut chicken pieces in half if thighs are large. If using pork, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces. In a saucepan, combine all ingredients. Let stand for 1 to 3 hours. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer for 30 minutes (45) minutes for pork). Remove cover and simmer 15 more minutes or until liquid evaporates and chicken/pork is lightly browned. Makes 6 servings.\n\nI would recommend preparing some white rice as a side dish. Please call me after you prepare this dish and tell me what you think... or just bring a little by so I can sample your version. Enjoy!\n\nSincerely, Glenn Seavey Larry Geweke Ford  $530 - 821 - 2121$",

U.S.)\n\n### **Pancake and Waffle Syrup**\n\nFollow the directions on the recipe folder in the MCP Pectin package for making any jelly, adding 1 /2 teaspoons baking soda (level, packed) to the juice and MCP Pectin in the kettle. Stir until foaming subsides. Bring to a boil. Add the specified amount of sugar, and bring to a full rolling boil (a boil that cannot be stirred down). Boil for 2 minutes. Skim foam.

Pour into sterilized jars. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 year.\n\n#### Microwave Jam and Jelly Guidelines (Yield: One-half the amount of the original recipe)\n\n- 1. Use one-half of the amounts called for in the recipe folder inside the pectin box. (One-half package of MCP Pectin measures 21/2 tablespoons.)\n- 2. Sift sugar before measuring to break down any lumps that may not dissolve during cooking. Measure sugar into dry bowl to be added later.\n- 3. Measure fruit or juice into 3- or 4-quart glass bowl. Add lemon juice if called for.\n- 4. Stir the MCP Pectin into fruit or juice, and microwave on high until mixture boils throughout (about 8-9 minutes). Stir midway through cooking time.\n- 5. Quickly stir in premeasured sugar. Mix well. Add 1/8 teaspoon margarine to reduce foaming.\n- 6. Microwave on high until the jam or jelly tests done (about 7-8 minutes). To determine doneness, use one of the tests listed below.\n- 7. Skim foam. Pour and seal according to directions on recipe folder.\n\n## **Spoon or Sheet Doneness Test for Jellies**\n\n- Dip a cool metal spoon in the jelly mixture. Raise the spoon above the kettle and turn the spoon so the syrup runs off the side of the spoon. If the syrup forms two drops that flow together and fall off the spoon as one sheet, the jelly should be done.\n- Refrigerator Doneness Test for Jams Pour a small amount of hot jam on a cold plate, and place it on the top shelf of a refrigerator for 2-3 minutes.

        "transcript": "## Crispy Almond Brittle\n\nThe texture of mut brittle is determined by the proportion of its ingredients: The more sugar, the harder the brittle; the more butter, the softer the brittle. Use a metal spatula to spread the mixture quickly (it hardens very fast) and evenly onto a baking sheet lined with lightly oiled baking parchment. Cut the brittle into pieces before it has hardened completely. To make the diamond-shaped pieces shown, cut the almond brittle diagonally in one direction and then cut parallel to the narrow edge of the pan. Store the brittle in an airtight tin in a cool place; it will\n\nkeep for 6-8 weeks.\n\n## Now Sry Shis\n\nA recommendation for peanst lovers: Substitute roasted peasuts for the almonds. Buy them roasted or roast them yourself in a skiller-you don't even need to add oil. It's easy to chop nuts by hand with a sharp chef's lenife. Hold the tip down with one hand and raise and lower the handle with the other. Pivot the blade in a fan shape back and forth over the nuts on the chopping board.\n\n## You'll Teed\n\n- $1$  % c. sugar\n- $\\frac{1}{2}$  /<sub>1</sub>  $\\epsilon$ , honey\n- 7 T. butter, softened\n- 16 1b. slivered aimonds\n- Vegetable oil\n- 4 squares (4 ozs.) semisweet baking chocolate\n\nThis recipe makes approximately 70 pieces\n\n1 Mix sugar and honey in saucepan and melt together, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\n2 Stirring constantly, add softened butter.

Label and date.\n\nbeef jerky\n\nJerky is raw meat or fish which is salted or marinated and dried. Although most any type of lean meat (beef, lamb, pork or game) or fish may be used, beef jerky is the easiest to make with the most reliable results. Choose any lean cut of beef. Flank, round or sirloin tip are excellent choices. Rump, if it is lean, is also a good choice. Use only a commercial or homemade electric food dehydrator. Do not attempt to dry meat in the sun due to risk of spoilage and contamination.\n\nFreeze meat slightly to aid in slicing. Cut beef in strips, 1/2-inch thick, across the grain for a tender, slightly brittle finished product. Cut with the grain for a chewy end product.\n\nThe meat must be \"cured\"; that is, treated in such a way to prevent spoilage. Dry cures are salt and seasonings rubbed on the meat surface. Brine cures are marinades or liquid seasoning mixtures in which the meat is soaked for a period of time. Vacuum packaging sliced meat and marinade will reduce the length of time it takes for the marinade to penetrate the meat. Not only is this method quicker, but it allows the narinade to penetrate deeper, locking in the great taste. Dry meat in an electric dehydrator at 145°F. If fat droplets appear having the drying process, blot meat with a paper towel. To test a slice of near, allow to cool. It should bend but not break. Jerky must be brought to an internal temperature of 160°F just prior as deging as immediately after drying. Two methods are recommended: sear mane errige in merinade before drying by boiling 5 minutes. Or, heat ketspitcated meat arrips to an over at 77% for 10 minutes after the drying\n\n### Soy Jerky\n\nYield: about 12 ounces of jerky\n\nsauce\n\n- 3 pounds lean beef\n- (flank, round or sirloin tip)\n- 3/4 cup soy sauce\n- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup brown sugar\n- 1 teaspoon onion powder\n- 1 clove garlic, crushed\n- 1/2 teaspoon cracked pepper\n\n**URNUMERIA** \n\n1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)\n\nCut beef into strips 1/2-inch thick. Combine marinade ingredients in a large, glass baking dish. Add strips of beef, cover and refrigerate overnight. Drain beef slices. Dry in an electric dehydrator at 145°F until pliable. Package in home canning jars, plastic storage container or vacuum package. Label and date.\n\nrubs\n\nDry rubs are used for the intense complement of flavors they impart, and the crusty coating they wrap around a wide variety of meat, poultry, seafood and game. Rubs made fresh surpass the spice blends or seasoning packets available in stores. They are easy to make even if you do not grow all the ingredients in your back yard. However, you can take full advantage of fresh herbs and other edibles you do grow. When purchasing ingredients to fill-in where you do not have your own supply, select whole spices and herbs, grinding them as needed.\n\nPreparing dry rubs takes no more than a few minutes. Ingredients can be crushed with a mortar and pestle, ground in a hand-held grinder or pulsed in a food processor. Be careful when using a food processor that the mixture does not break down too fat, causing natural oils to release. If this happens the rub will need to be used quickly because the oils will turn rancid.",

(To test dough, drop 1/2-teaspoon ball of dough in cold water When the dough floats, the tamale dough is ready for shaping.) The mixture will be the texture of mashed potatoes. Add more broth, if needed, to reach desired consistency.\n\n6. Drain cornhusks well; pat dry with paper towels. To assemble each tamale, starting about 1 inch from the narrow edge of the husk, spread about 2 tablespoons of dough into a rectangle 3 inches wide and 4 inches long so one of the long sides of the tamale dough is at the long edge of the wrapper. Spoon I heaping tablespoon meat filling down center. Place 2 olive halves in the center. Fold the long edge of wrapper over the filling so it overlaps dough slightly. Fold the narrow end of husk over filling, then continue rolling. If desired, tie strips of cornhusk or a 100-percent-cotton kitchen string around center of tamale. 7. To prepare steamer, place a cone-shape piece of aluminum foil, point side up, in the center of steamer basket. Stand tamales upright around cone; place basket in steamer or large Dutch oven. (Don't pack tamales too tightly, but fill the space.) Place about 1 1/2 inches of water in the bottom of steamer. Bring to boiling. Cover steamer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Steam for 45 to 60 minutes. Tamales are done when dough easily pulls away from cornhusks and is spongy and well-cooked throughout. Makes 36 tamales. MAKE-AHEAD TIP: You can wrap tamales in foil and refrigerate up to 2 days before serving, or freeze them up to 3 months. To reheat refrigerated tamales, steam them still wrapped in the husks, for 8 to 10 minutes or until heated through. To reheat frozen tamales, take them directly from the freezer, wrapped in foil (do not pack tightly), and heat them in a 350°F oven for 11/4 to 11/2 hours. \\*TEST KITCHEN TIP: For a milder tamale, use 4 dried ancho and 2 dried New Mexico peppers.

I put the meatballs in a pot and heat them up in the gravy when I am ready to serve or freeze them in the gravy.",

Maybe that's because I'm not so good at making them. My friend Sandi, on the other hand, makes a faller salad. Here are her rules:\n\n- 1. Use a good homemade salad dressing (see recipes).\n- 2. Dress the salad in moderation-don't drown the greens.\n- 3. Use greens that actually have some. flavor-arugula, spring mix, frisée, spinach, radicchio, máche, watercress and endive.\n- 4. Consider contrasts in your saladsweet dried cranberries or raisins with sharp feta cheese, rich walnuts with bright crisp radishes or carrots.\n- 5. Actually toss the salad. This way all the ingredients get coated with the dressing. (There's a reason it's called a \"tossed\" salad.) -Jill Melton\n\n## **Homemade Ranch** Dressing\n\nBecause it's a best-selling salad dressing and is served with everything from chicken wings to pizza, we felt we owed it to readers to print a recipe for homemade ranch dressing (and because homemade is so much better than the bottled version).

Let stand in hot water until ready to use. Drain well before filling.\n- 3. Prepare fruit as directed in following charts. For berries, crush 1 cup at a time, using a potato masher for best results. If using food processor, pulse to chop. DO NOT PUREE. Jam should have bits of fruit.\n- 4. Measure exact amount of prepared fruit (or juice for jelly) into 6- or 8-quart saucepot. Stir in lemon juice and water (if required) as indicated in chart.\n- 5. Measure exact amount of sugar into separate bowl. (REDUCING SUGAR OR USING SUGAR SUBSTITUTES WILL RESULT IN SET FAILURES.) Try Sure-Jell for Less or No Sugar Needed Recipes Fruit Pectin for no- or low-sugar jams and jellies.\n- 6. Stir 1 box pectin into fruit or juice in saucepot. Add 1/2 teaspoon butter or margarine to reduce foaming, if desired.\n- 7. Bring mixture to full rolling boil (a boil that doesn't stop bubbling when stirred) on high heat, stirring constantly.\n- 8. Stir in sugar quickly. Return to full rolling boil and boil exactly 4 minutes for JAMS and 2 minutes for JELLIES, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Skim off any foam with metal spoon.\n- 9. Ladle quickly into prepared jars, filling to within 1/8 inch of tops. Wipe jar rims and threads. Cover with two-piece lids. Screw bands tightly (see Note on reverse side)\\*. Place jars on elevated rack in canner. Lower rack into canner. Water must cover jars by 1 to 2 inches; add boiling water if needed. Cover; bring water to gentle boil. Process jams 10 minutes; jelly 5 minutes. Adjust processing time according to Altitude Chart (on reverse side). Remove jars and place upright on a towel to cool completely. After jars cool, check seals by pressing middle of\n\nlid with finger. (If lid springs back, lid is not sealed and refrigeration is necessary.) 10. Let stand at room temperature 24 hours (or time indicated on recipe). Store unopened jams and jellies in cool, dry, dark place up to 1 year, Refrigerate opened jams and jellies up to 3 weeks. **CONTRACTOR DE REALITA**",

        "transcript": "## **PREMIUM FRUIT PECTIN**\n\n## before you start-\n\n## important tips for success\n\nUse firm ripe fruit for best flavor and set. Over-ripe fruit makes a soft set. Under-ripe fruit makes a firm set.\n\nBuy new, flat jar lids for a good seal.\n\nAlways use clean jars. Thoroughly wash jars or containers before starting.\n\nUse only the Sure-Jell® pectin product specified in the recipes to insure a proper set. Pectin products are not interchangeable.\n\nMeasure ingredients exactly. Spoon sugar into dry (metal or plastic) measuring cups. Scrape excess sugar from top of cup with a straight-edged knife. Use liquid (glass or plastic) measuring cups with a pour spout to measure prepared fruit. (Use amount of sugar specified in each recipe. ALTERING RECIPES or INGREDIENTS could cause a set failure.)\n\nSome jams and jellies may take up to 2 weeks to set. See individual recipes.\n\nTo make homemade jam & jelly with less sugar, look for Sure-Jell<sup>®</sup> for Less or No Sugar Needed Recipes in the pink box.\n\n## quick & easy freezer jam directions\n\n(Takes about half the time of cooked method, softer set, fresh fruit taste.)\n\n- 1. Wash and rinse plastic containers with tight fitting lids. Use 1 to 2 cup size containers.\n- 2. Prepare fruit as directed in following chart. (For berries, crush 1 cup at a time, using a potato masher for best results. If using food processor, pulse to very finely chop. DO NOT PUREE. Jam should have bits of fruit.)\n- 3. Measure exact amount of prepared fruit along with lemon juice (if called for in recipe) into a large bowl.\n- 4. Measure exact amount of sugar into separate bowl. (REDUCING SUGAR OR USING SUGAR SUBSTITUTES WILL RESULT IN SET FAILURES.) Try Sure-Jell for Less or No Sugar Needed Recipes Fruit Pectin for no- or low-sugar jams and jellies.\n- 5. Gradually stir 1 box pectin into fruit. Mix thoroughly. Set aside 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes to dissolve pectin thoroughly.\n- 6. Pour 1 cup light corn syrup into fruit mixture. Mix well. This prevents sugar crystallization during freezer storage.",

Otherwise, skip DEAR ABBY today.\n\nDear Abby\n\nNearly 15 years ago. I was honored at a dinner party at the Phoenix Hotel in Lexington. Ky. Pecan pie was served for dessert. But what pecan pie! Never had I tasted anything so delicious. After dinner I went to the kitchen to congratulate the party chef. He was so pleased, he gave me the recipe.\n\nvanilla and mix well. Add slightly beaten eggs. Pour into a 9 inch UNBAKED pie shell. Sprinkle pecans over all. Bake in pre-heated 350° oven for approximately 45 minutes. When cool, you may top with whipped cream or ice cream ... but nothing tops this!\n\nAbigail Van Euren\n\nPlease let me know how your cheese-\n\nI tried it at home. Mine was every bit as good as his. And it was so easy to make that I wrote and asked permission to share the recipe with my readers. He cooperated, and I published it.\n\nNotes came by the thousands saying, \"That was the best pecan pie my family has ever tasted.\" So here is the recipe:\n\n## **KENTUCKY PECAN PIE**\n\n1 cup white corn syrup 1 cup dark brown sugar  $\\frac{1}{3}$  teaspoon salt  $\\frac{1}{2}$  cup melted butter (or margarine) 1 teaspon vanilla 3 whole eggs (slightly beaten) 1 heaping cup shelled whole pecans Combine syrup, sugar, salt, butter,\n\ncake ano/or pecal pie turned out.\n\n## \\* \\* \\*\n\nA ND DONT forget to have one of the  $\\perp$  children say the blessing. (Or say it yourself.) Here is mine:\n\n\"Oh, heavenly Father, we thank Thee for food and remember the hungry. We thank Thee for health, and remember the sick.

        "transcript": "Dry rubs store on the shelf for 1 to 3 assurabs, depending on the blend of ingredients. Not all ingredients will age at the same rate, so the flavor of the rub may change the longer it is moved. This is one reason why it is bear to prepare small amounts and use them quickly. Rubs are sensitive to light and heat. Keep dry rubs in a home canning jar or plastic murage container and place in a cabinet to protect the rub from light and hear.\n\nThe reasoning or flavoring characteristics of a dry rub is givar. Only a small amount. I tablespoon or less, is needed to season a single fish filler, chicken breast or steak. Larger cuts of meat or whole portions of poultry and fish use about 16 cup. Depending on how the dry rub is to be used, there may be some remaining for a second use. To prevent the contamination of remaining rub during initial use, measure only the amount of rub needed for one application in a separate dish.\n\nRubs are often prepared using fresh ingredients. But many of the same ingredients can be used in their dry state. The time required to airdry fresh ingredients can be minimized using a dehydrator.\n\n## Island Jerk Rub\n\n- 6 dried habañero peppers\n- 6 dried scallions\n- 11/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n  - 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n\nRecommended Use: Shrimp, chicken bease and lands lobobs.

Let shrimp stand 2 m 4 hours; chicken and lamb cubes 4 or 6 hours in a cool place. Grill.\n\n# vegetables\n\nMost vegetables, from asparagus to mechini, can be dehydrated at home. Select garden fresh, top quality produce for the best results. Remember, although dried regetables retain most of their vitamin and mineral content and good flavor, the original quality cannot be improved.\n\nAll vegetables require some preparation, such as removing stems, peel. or seeds, before drying. Like fruits, uniformly cut slices or pieces result in even drying. Unlike fruits, regerables are better out slightly smaller to hasten drying time. Vegetables lose flavor and tenderness if the drying time is prolonged. Drying time varies from about 4 to 14 hours. A temperature of 125°F is recommended for most vegetables. Finished vegetables should contain about 5% moisture. When tested, vegetables should, look and feel crisp or brittle.\n\n- 2 tablespoons whole allspice\n- 1 tablespoon coarse salt\n- 2 teaspoons cayenne pepper\n- 1 teaspoon coarse\n  - ground black pepper\n\nCrush or grind habañero peppers, scallions and whole allspice to a coarse powder. Add remaining ingredients and grind to a uniformly coarse powder. Store in home canning jar, plastic jar or plastic storage container. Label and date.\n\nRecommended Use: Shrimp, chicken breast, pork chops, spareribs and beef or lamb kabobs. Drench meat in a sauce prepared with 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons canola oil and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Apply rub. Let shrimp stand 2 to 4 hours; chicken, beef and lamb cubes 4 to 6 hours; pork 3 to 4 hours and ribs overnight in a cool place. Grill.\n\nNote: When cutting or seeding hot peppers, wear rubber gloves to prevent hands from being burned.\n\n# Kitchen Herb Garden Rub\n\n- 1 cup dried parsley V<sub>2</sub> cup dried oregano **We cup dried rosemary**\n- 2 tablespoons dried tarragon\n\njust or phaseic morage corespiracy.

Let chicken and fish stand 2 to 4 hours in a cool place. Grill.\n\n#### Lemon-Cumin Spice Rub\n\nVegetables can be eaten dried, but they are usually reconstituted before using. An equal volume of water and vegetables is needed. Boiling water will shorten the rehydration time.\n\nGenerally, it takes 15 minutes to 3 hours for reconstituting vegetables. depending on the texture and thickness of the vegetables.\n\nIf a vegetable is not listed in the following pages, freezing or canning may be a more suitable method of food preservation.\n\nPack dehydrated vegetables in home canning jars, plastic jars, plastic storage containers or vacuum package. Label and date.\n\n#### **Asparagus**\n\nChoose young, tender stalks. Wash; cut off tough end. Slice into 1-inch pieces. Steam blanch 3 to 4 minutes. Dry at 125°F until brittle.

        "transcript": "## PASS A PIECE-A PASTA PIE\n\nCousin Ginny, Aunt Patsy's daughter knows \"no offer!\" But to her this word. \"pasta,\" means either something afready happened, past tense, or someone better \"pasta\" the food real quick before Cousin David eats it all!\n\nI onion chopped I lb ground turkey (or hamburger). 1-141/2 or stewed tomatoes, undrained 1-15 oz can tomato sauce I teaspoon thyme leaves I teaspoon basil leaves 16 teaspoon ground cumin 14 teaspoon salt dash pepper 1-11 oz can corn, drained 1-15 oz can black beans (or kidneys) 1-6 oz can small black pitted olives, drained I cup chopped green pepper 12 oz spaghetti noodles (no, Aunt Patsy doesn't have any so you'll have to use brand X!) 3 cups (12 oz) grated cheddar cheese\n\n## **STACK A MAC**\n\nThe only thing stacked about Aunt Patsy is her macaroni? This is a \"dinner version\" of an ice cream sundae with toppenes.\n\nI lb lean ground beef or turkey I cup chopped onion 1-15 or can tomato sauce L-R or can formato tauce I teaspoon dried oregano leaves I teaspoon dried basil leaves I teaspoon dried thyme leaves 14 teaspoon salt 14 teaspoon pepper 12 or Aunt Patsy's pasta, cooked, or 4 cups cooked rice 1-10 oz package frozen peas (2 cups) 8 oz cheddar cheese, grated\n\nIn a skillet, brown the meat with onion, drain off fat. Add tomato sauces, oregano, basil, thyme, salt and pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes. Meanwhile cook the pasta or rice according to instructions. Cook peas. On individual plates . . . start stacking! First mac (or rice) then the meat mixture then peas then cheese. Need a \"cherry\" on top? Try a chili pepper.\n\n(Similar to Russian Stroganoff)\n\nCousin David used to bring home a friend called \"Strop.\" He used to like this chicken dish so much and would help. himself to so many servings that Aunt. Patsy was always yelling ... \"Stron! Fnough! Enough!\"\n\n> I small onion, chopped. 2 Ib boneless, skinless chicken breasts. cut in small cubes 2 tablespoons oil 1/3 cup butter (the real stuff!) 2/3 cup flour I teaspoon thyme dash nutmeg I cup chicken broth I cup milk 1/2 cup white wine 1/2 teaspoon salt % cup grated parmesan cheese 4 oz can mushrooms, drained, (or 1/4 lb fresh mushrooms, sliced and sauted) 8 oz sour cream (very optional - this is pretty creamy already) 12 oz of your favorite Aunt Patsy Pasta cooked according to instructions\n\nBrown onion and turkey in large skillet. Drain any grease. Add stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, thyme, basil, cumin, salt, and pepper. Now just let this stuff simmer for 15-20 minutes, till thicker. Dump in the drained corn, beans, olives, and green pepper. If your skillet wasn't large enough, you'll have to dump this all in a large bowl so you can mix it without decorating the counter with it! Don't squash the olives when you mix (Cousin David can't get squashed olives to stay on his fingers).\n\nCook the spaghetti according the directions and drain. Lightly grease two 10\" pie plates and arrange the spaghetti as a crust. Cousin Ginny doesn't have 10\" pie plates, so she uses 8\" square pans. She says instead of pasta pies she now has a square meal!\n\nDivide the stuff from the large bowl (unless you were one of the smart large skillet people) into the 2 \"pie crusts.\" Sprinkle the cheese on top of both. Bake at 375° for 40 minutes. Cut and serve.\n\nYes, this does make alot of pie. At Aunt Patsy's house, Cousin David eats one and the whole rest of the family splits the other one. Or cut the recipe in half. Cousin Ginny freezes one for later (we think you can freeze this anyway . . .).\n\n## APPLE MAC SALAD\n\nAunt Patsy would prefer a recipe for Apple Jack but we told her this was a family recipe edition.\n\n> 2 cups cubed red apples 2 cups (dry) pasta-cooked I cup chopped celery 1/2 cup walnut pieces (or almonds) cup good quality mayonnaise 2 tablespoons lemon juice I teaspoon sugar\n\nMix all of the ingredients except the pasta together in a large bowl. Put the bowl in the fridge to chill. Just before serving time, cook the pasta according to directions. Rinse with cold water until cool. Drain. Add the cooked pasta to the other ingredients. Gently stir together and serve.\n\nQuickly stir-fry the chicken and onions in a pan with the 2 tablespoons oil till the chicken is done, about 10 minutes. Remove to dish and keep warm.\n\nMelt the 1/3 cup butter in the pan, add the flour and blend in. Dump in the thyme, salt, and dash of nutmeg. Gradually add the chicken broth, milk, and wine (sometimes we catch Aunt Patsy adding the wine to herself not the recipe!) Continue to cook and stir till the sauce boils and thickens. Now dump in the parmesan cheese and cook just a little more. Add the chicken, onions, and mushrooms and heat thoroughly. If you like the way it tastes right now, stop, you're done. But if you want it even creamier, and can handle more fat, er, richness, throw in the sour cream. Lather the sauce over a plate of noodles and serve.\n\nThe noodles and sauce concoction can also be thrown all together in a casserole dish and baked for 30 minutes, too. This was Strog's favorite version cause then he could help himself to several large spoonfuls. Strog! Enough! Enough!",

Thin, crisp, and shiny they make striking desserts or impressive gifts.\n\nFragile to bite, the cookies are much easier to make and sturdier to handle than they look. The process is simple-but it requires some careful attention.\n\nAs the caramel around the nuts bakes, it spreads into a very thin layer 5 to 6 inches in diameter. You can bake only a few cosises at a time.\n\nwhile hot, the caramel is soft. As it cools, the cookies become rigid. The trick is to get them off the pan after they harden enough not to stretch and tear, but before they get so brittle they break.\n\nStored airtight, these cookies stay crisp. If you want to make them more than a week ahead, they should be frozen for best flavor. W you're giving them away, handcarry them-very carefully.\n\nTo create a striking visual effect and an easier-than-pie desse.t, tuck a cooky vertically into a bowl of your favorite flavor of ice cream.\n\n## **Nut Lace Cookles**\n\n- a cup (% lb.) butter or margarine\n- a cup each light com syrup and firmly packed brown sugar\n  - the allowpose four\n  - cup muse whole or nati almonds, hazewatc, suchadamias, pecans, pine nuts, parachica, and walnuts, plain or swied (or eny combination of thuse nurse\n\nand nuts. slightly.

Remove pan from heat and blend in flour\n\nGrease and flour 12- by 15-inch or 14- by 17-inch baking sheets (they must be flat, not warped). For each cooky, place 2 tablespoons of the nut mixture about 8 inches apart on the sheet-put only 2 cookies on a pan at a time.\n\nWith your fingers, push nuts apart into a 3- to 4-inch circle or oval. Bake in a 350° oven until cookies are a rich golden brown, about 10 minutes (if you have 2 pans in the oven, alternate positions at midpoint to ensure even browning).\n\nRemove cookies from oven and let them cool on the pan until they firm up slightly, about 2 minutes; to test, slide a spatula under a corner. If the cooky is stretchy, wait just a few seconds longer. If it is hard, slide spatula under carefully and lift onto a rack. If cookies get too hard and stick to pan, return to oven to soften\n\nWhen cool, serve, or immediately package airtight in rigid container. Cookies absorb moisture and lose their crispness quickly. If you stack the cookies in the containers, separate each layer with a sheet of waxed paper to protect them from breaking and sticking together. Hold at room temperature up to I week or freeze up to I month.\n\nPer cooky (made with 1/2 salted nuts): 178 cal.; 1.9 g protein; 16 g carbo.; 12 g fat; 12 mg chol.;\n\nNORMAN A.

        "transcript": "Cakes may be divided into two classes-Butter and Butterless or Sponge. A good Butter cake should be fine grained or of smooth texture. This is obtained by accurate measuring and skill in combining ingredients which require effort and time. The butter should be creamed until light colored. Fine granulated sugar should then be blended well with it. Eggs should be separated and well beaten before adding.\n\nDry ingredients should be sifted before and after measuring and these should be added alternately with the milk to the butter, sugar, and egg mixtures. Beaten egg whites and flavoring should be then folded into batter. Butter cakes require a moderate oven-350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Sponge cakes require a slow oven-275 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Sponge cakes contain little liquid but great amounts of egg. Angel cake is a type of Sponge cake. Do not grease pans for sponge cakes. Frost cakes after they are cold.\n\nFrosting should be cold when put on.\n\nSkill is required in making good pastry. Flakiness, crispness and tenderness are characteristics of good pastry; and these are realized by the selection of good ingredients, accurate measurements and skillful mixing.\n\nPastry should not be made in a warm temperature.\n\nShortening should be worked in with a blender.\n\nIce water is conducive to tender pastry,",

        "transcript": "## **B**elCrous **IMPROVISATION ZUCCHINI-MUSHROOM CASSEROLE**\n\n## By ROLAND A. BROWNE\n\nI am convinced that many of the really great dishes of this world have resulted from cooks' putting together the foods that just happened to be on hand. Consider beans with chill peppers; comed beef and cabbage; saverkraut with ham and sausage, cathan and hush puppies Or take Pennsylvania Dutch apple pie, containing frosh apples, black walnuts and raisins. The apples and walnuts would ripen together in the late fall, but fresh grapes would long since have gone; only dried grapes would be on hand as **TAISINS** \n\nRecently my wife had to take off for Washington on family concerns, leaving me to do the cooking in her absence. Like any prudent husband, I studied the contents of the refrigerator before doing any substantial food shopping. The vegetable drawer yielded the following items: 1 pound zucchini, 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms and 1/2 basket cherry tomatoes. All needed to be used promptly if they weren't to spoil. Further rummaging produced some mozzarella cheese, some Parmesan cheese and a box of bread crumbs. These seemed like promising materials for a little Italian-style cooking. They turned into one of the best casseroles I have eaten in a long time. Here's my recipe. 1 Cut 1 pound zucchini in 1/4-inch slices, spread out on paper towel, sprinkle liberally with salt and let stand about 1 hour to draw out liquid. Blot dry with another paper towel. 2 Meanwhile with damp paper towel wipe off about 1/4 pound mushrooms; slice and set aside. 3 In large skillet add just enough olive oil to coat bottom (about 2 tablespoons): heat, then quickly brown zucchini; transfer to 1-quart casserole. 4 Add more oil to skillet if necessary and sauté mushrooms and 1 tablespoon minced onion just a few minutes until golden; spoon over zucchini in casserole. 5 Using about 1/2 basket cherry tomatoes, cut tomatoes in half and arrange over mushrooms. (One large tomato, sliced, or well-drained canned tomatoes may be substituted.) 6 Season casserole with 1 clove garlic, minced, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning herbs and salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7 Cut about 3 ounces mozzarella cheese in strips and layer over tomatoes.\n\n8 Sprinkle with 3 tablespoons bread crumbs, then 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese and a dash of paprika.\n\n9 Cover and bake in preheated 375°",

For best results, it is important to always follow these guidelines:\n\n- · Read all information first\n- · Follow recipe exactly.\n- . Do not reduce the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. The exact amounts of sugar, fruit, acid and pectin are necessary for a good set.\n- . Do not double recipes; mixture may not set.\n- . Use ripe fruit for best flavor and color.\n- . Crush, grind or finely chop all fruit thoroughly.\n- · Use proper size saucepot.\n- . Always add pectin before the sugar.\n- . A full rolling boil is a boil that does not stop when stirred.\n\n# **JAM AND JELLY MAKING AIDS**\n\n- . Decorative Contact Lobels (5 dozen) for \\$1.75 and 1 UPC Symbol.\n- .

Box 8274, Kankakee, IL 60902.\n\n# **NO-COOK FREEZER JAM DIRECTIONS**\n\nFRUIT NEEDED: Start with approximately 2 quarts berries or 3 pounds fruit at room temperature.\n\n. Store unopened packages of MCP® Pectin in a cool, dry place.\n\n### **EQUIPMENT**\n\nAssemble the following pieces of equipment before starting to make jam or jelly:\n\n- For cooked jams and jellies: half pint (8 ounce) or pint (16 ounce) glass jelly jars\n- . For freezer jams and jellies: plastic containers (8 ounce) with tightfitting lids\n- Mixing spoon, measuring spoons\n- . Glass or plastic liquid measuring cup with pour spout for fruit pulp and other liquids\n- . Metal or plastic dry measuring cup with straight top edge for sugar\n- Potato masher or food grinder\n- . Bowls for preparing fruit and premeasuring sugar\n- 6- to 8-quart saucepot\n- . For jellies: MCP® Juice Extracting Kit or colander and cheesecloth\n\n# **MEASURE INGREDIENTS CAREFULLY**\n\n- . Use standard measuring cups and level measures for all ingredients,\n- . If a little short of juice for jellies, add up to 1/2 cup water.\n\nTO PREPARE CONTAINERS: Rinse clean plastic containers and lids with boiling water.\n\n#### **TO PREPARE FRUIT:**\n\nBerries and Grapes: Wash fruit. Stem and seed, if necessary. Grind or crush thoroughly until reduced to a pulp. Sieve 1/2 of the pulp to remove some seeds, if desired.\n\nOther Fruit: Wash. Peel figs, kiwis or peaches. Pit, slice and grind or finely chop.\n\n#### **TO PREPARE JAM:**\n\n- 1. MEASURE prepared fruit and lemon juice, if called for, into large bowl. Measure sugar into separate bowl. Set aside. Gradually stir 1 package MCP® Pectin into fruit; mix thoroughly. Set aside 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes to dissolve pectin thoroughly.\n- 2. POUR corn syrup into fruit mixture; mix well. This prevents sugar crystallization during freezer storage.\n- 3. STIR in sugar gradually. Continue stirring to dissolve completely.\n- 4. POUR into containers to within 1/2 inch of tops. Wipe off edges of containers; cover with lids. Freeze.\n\n| <b>NO-COOK FREEZER JAMS</b> |                                           |                         |                                 |                                            |                 |                               |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                             | <b>Prepared</b><br><b>Fruit</b><br>(cups) | Lemon<br>Juice<br>(cup) | <b>MCP®</b><br>Pectin<br>(pkg.) | <b>Light Corn</b><br><b>Syrup</b><br>(cup) | Sugar<br>(cups) | Yleld<br>(801)<br>containers) |\n| Fruit                       |                                           |                         |                                 |                                            | 41/2            |                               |\n| <b>Apricot</b>              |                                           | $\\frac{1}{2}$           |                                 |                                            |                 |                               |",

Let eggs stand, covered, in the hot water, about 15 minutes for medium eggs, 18 minutes for large and 20 for extra-large. Immediately run cold water over the eggs or place them in ice water until completely cooled. To remove shell, crackle it by tapping it gently all over. Roll the egg between your hands to loosen the shell. Peel, starting at the large end. Hold the egg under running cold water or dip it in a bowl of water to help ease off the shell.\n\nSoft-cooked eggs: Follow directions for hard-cooked eggs, but let eggs stand, covered, in hot water only about one to five minutes, depending on how done you prefer them. Place in egg cups, crack tops of shells and remove the tops to eat.\n\n## COOKING EGGS 101\n\nPoached eggs: In saucepan or deep skillet, bring 2 to 3 inches of water to boiling. Reduce heat to keep water gently simmering. Break cold eggs, one at a time, into custard cup or saucer. Hold dish close to water's surface; slip eggs into water. Cook until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard, about three to five minutes. With slotted spoon, lift out eggs. Drain in spoon or on paper towels.\n\nramekin, shallow baking dish or 10-ounce custard cup. Spoon 1 tablespoon milk, half-and-half or light cream over eggs. Bake in preheated 325-degree oven until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not\n\nBaked (shirred) eggs: For one to two servings, break and slip two eggs into greased hard, about 12 to 18 minutes, depending on number of servings being baked.\n\nFried eggs: For one to two servings, in 7-to 8-inch omelet pan or skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 teaspoon to 2 tablespoons butter or cooking oil (or use cooking spray) until just here enough to sizzle a drop of water. Break and sig-2 eggs into pan. Immediately reduce heat to low. Cook slowly until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not hard. Cover tightly with a lid, spooning butter over easy to baste or turning eggs to cook both sides. For over easy or over hard, gently lift eggs with pancake turner and flip upside down into pan. Cook second side.",
