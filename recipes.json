To assemble each tamale, starting about 1 inch from the narrow edge of the husk, spread about 2 tablespoons of dough into a rectangle 3 inches wide and 4 inches long so one of the long sides of the tamale dough is at the long edge of the wrapper. Spoon I heaping tablespoon meat filling down center. Place 2 olive halves in the center. Fold the long edge of wrapper over the filling so it overlaps dough slightly. Fold the narrow end of husk over filling, then continue rolling. If desired, tie strips of cornhusk or a 100-percent-cotton kitchen string around center of tamale. 7. To prepare steamer, place a cone-shape piece of aluminum foil, point side up, in the center of steamer basket. Stand tamales upright around cone; place basket in steamer or large Dutch oven. (Don't pack tamales too tightly, but fill the space.) Place about 1 1/2 inches of water in the bottom of steamer. Bring to boiling. Cover steamer. Reduce heat to medium-low. Steam for 45 to 60 minutes. Tamales are done when dough easily pulls away from cornhusks and is spongy and well-cooked throughout. Makes 36 tamales. MAKE-AHEAD TIP: You can wrap tamales in foil and refrigerate up to 2 days before serving, or freeze them up to 3 months. To reheat refrigerated tamales, steam them still wrapped in the husks, for 8 to 10 minutes or until heated through. To reheat frozen tamales, take them directly from the freezer, wrapped in foil (do not pack tightly), and heat them in a 350\u00b0F oven for 11/4 to 11/2 hours. \\*TEST KITCHEN TIP: For a milder tamale, use 4 dried ancho and 2 dried New Mexico peppers.

Put mixture in large mixer bowl and beat at low speed 1 minute to cool slightly. Add eggs all at once and beat at medium speed, scraping sides of bowl while beating, about 2 minutes or until batter is thick and begins to cling to beaters. Beat about 2 minutes longer, lifting up beaters slightly several times to allow dough to run off a bit. Mixture will be very thick. Using 2 tablespoonfuls each, drop 16 mounds about 1-1/2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 425\u00b0 oven 20 minutes; reduce heat to 375\u00b0 and bake 15 minutes longer or until golden and firm. Turn off oven. Remove puffs from oven and with small knife make small slit in side of each. Return to oven, leaving door slightly ajar, 10 minutes. Remove to racks to cool. Not more than 2 hours before serving, split with sharp knife and fill each puff with about 3 tablespoons Sherry-Custard Filling. Drizzle with Sherry-Sugar Glaze.

Like any prudent husband, I studied the contents of the refrigerator before doing any substantial food shopping. The vegetable drawer yielded the following items: 1 pound zucchini, 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms and 1/2 basket cherry tomatoes. All needed to be used promptly if they weren't to spoil. Further rummaging produced some mozzarella cheese, some Parmesan cheese and a box of bread crumbs. These seemed like promising materials for a little Italian-style cooking. They turned into one of the best casseroles I have eaten in a long time. Here's my recipe. 1 Cut 1 pound zucchini in 1/4-inch slices, spread out on paper towel, sprinkle liberally with salt and let stand about 1 hour to draw out liquid. Blot dry with another paper towel. 2 Meanwhile with damp paper towel wipe off about 1/4 pound mushrooms; slice and set aside. 3 In large skillet add just enough olive oil to coat bottom (about 2 tablespoons): heat, then quickly brown zucchini; transfer to 1-quart casserole. 4 Add more oil to skillet if necessary and saut\u00e9 mushrooms and 1 tablespoon minced onion just a few minutes until golden; spoon over zucchini in casserole. 5 Using about 1/2 basket cherry tomatoes, cut tomatoes in half and arrange over mushrooms. (One large tomato, sliced, or well-drained canned tomatoes may be substituted.) 6 Season casserole with 1 clove garlic, minced, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning herbs and salt and pepper to taste.",
