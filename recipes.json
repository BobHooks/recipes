Lift iron out and shake off excess oil (or blot on paper toweling). Dip iron into batter only to the depth of the molds. Avoid getting batter on top of molds. Immerse molds into hot oil, covering completely. When foamy bubbling stops, or Rosettes are a delicate brown, lift iron out, allowing excess oil to drip back into fryer. To remove Rosette, gently tap on top of mold with a wooden spoon. Before making additional Rosettes, reheat iron as necessary. (Iron must be hot!)\n- If excess batter adheres to top of mold, fry as usual, then gently remove excess with knife for easier release.\n- If batter will not adhere to molds, oil may be either too hot or too cold. Check with thermometer and adjust accordingly.\n- If first Rosette Cookies are not crisp, thin batter with a little milk. Also check the temperature of oil and molds.\n- Cool, with the more open side down, on rack or paper towelling.\n- To store: Layer cooled cookies nor more than 3 deep in air-tight container. May be frozen.\n\nNo need to defrost before serving. If needed, recrisp in 300\u00b0 oven 3-5 minutes.\n\nThe following recipes apply to these Instant Cookie and Patty Shell Sets:\n\n-"

I love the food and the culture and would like to share this love with you. The recipe below for Basic Adobo is one of my favorites. It is a Phillipino dish that is very easy to make and \"ono\" good.\n\nBasic Adobo Ingredients: 3 1b. chicken thighs or 3 1b. pork butt 1/2 cup vinegar 1/4 cup soy sauce 3 cloves of garlic 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon peppercorns, crushed 1 bay leaf, crushed Cut chicken pieces in half if thighs are large. If using pork, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces. In a saucepan, combine all ingredients. Let stand for 1 to 3 hours. Bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat, and simmer for 30 minutes (45) minutes for pork). Remove cover and simmer 15 more minutes or until liquid evaporates and chicken/pork is lightly browned. Makes 6 servings.\n\nI would recommend preparing some white rice as a side dish. Please call me after you prepare this dish and tell me what you think... or just bring a little by so I can sample your version. Enjoy!\n\nSincerely, Glenn Seavey Larry Geweke Ford  $530 - 821 - 2121$"

Maybe that's because I'm not so good at making them. My friend Sandi, on the other hand, makes a faller salad. Here are her rules:\n\n- 1. Use a good homemade salad dressing (see recipes).\n- 2. Dress the salad in moderation-don't drown the greens.\n- 3. Use greens that actually have some. flavor-arugula, spring mix, fris\u00e9e, spinach, radicchio, m\u00e1che, watercress and endive.\n- 4. Consider contrasts in your saladsweet dried cranberries or raisins with sharp feta cheese, rich walnuts with bright crisp radishes or carrots.\n- 5. Actually toss the salad. This way all the ingredients get coated with the dressing. (There's a reason it's called a \"tossed\" salad.) -Jill Melton"

Not all ingredients will age at the same rate, so the flavor of the rub may change the longer it is moved. This is one reason why it is bear to prepare small amounts and use them quickly. Rubs are sensitive to light and heat. Keep dry rubs in a home canning jar or plastic murage container and place in a cabinet to protect the rub from light and hear.\n\nThe reasoning or flavoring characteristics of a dry rub is givar. Only a small amount. I tablespoon or less, is needed to season a single fish filler, chicken breast or steak. Larger cuts of meat or whole portions of poultry and fish use about 16 cup. Depending on how the dry rub is to be used, there may be some remaining for a second use. To prevent the contamination of remaining rub during initial use, measure only the amount of rub needed for one application in a separate dish.\n\nRubs are often prepared using fresh ingredients. But many of the same ingredients can be used in their dry state. The time required to airdry fresh ingredients can be minimized using a dehydrator."

Thin, crisp, and shiny they make striking desserts or impressive gifts.\n\nFragile to bite, the cookies are much easier to make and sturdier to handle than they look. The process is simple-but it requires some careful attention.\n\nAs the caramel around the nuts bakes, it spreads into a very thin layer 5 to 6 inches in diameter. You can bake only a few cosises at a time.\n\nwhile hot, the caramel is soft. As it cools, the cookies become rigid. The trick is to get them off the pan after they harden enough not to stretch and tear, but before they get so brittle they break.\n\nStored airtight, these cookies stay crisp. If you want to make them more than a week ahead, they should be frozen for best flavor. W you're giving them away, handcarry them-very carefully.\n\nTo create a striking visual effect and an easier-than-pie desse.t, tuck a cooky vertically into a bowl of your favorite flavor of ice cream."

    "title": "Pastry Techniques",
    "content": "Cakes may be divided into two classes-Butter and Butterless or Sponge. A good Butter cake should be fine grained or of smooth texture. This is obtained by accurate measuring and skill in combining ingredients which require effort and time. The butter should be creamed until light colored. Fine granulated sugar should then be blended well with it. Eggs should be separated and well beaten before adding.\n\nDry ingredients should be sifted before and after measuring and these should be added alternately with the milk to the butter, sugar, and egg mixtures. Beaten egg whites and flavoring should be then folded into batter. Butter cakes require a moderate oven-350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Sponge cakes require a slow oven-275 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Sponge cakes contain little liquid but great amounts of egg. Angel cake is a type of Sponge cake. Do not grease pans for sponge cakes. Frost cakes after they are cold.\n\nFrosting should be cold when put on.\n\nSkill is required in making good pastry. Flakiness, crispness and tenderness are characteristics of good pastry; and these are realized by the selection of good ingredients, accurate measurements and skillful mixing.\n\nPastry should not be made in a warm temperature.\n\nShortening should be worked in with a blender.\n\nIce water is conducive to tender pastry,"
